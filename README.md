# TypeScript middleware pipeline

Typescriptified version of the [js-middleware](https://github.com/unbug/js-middleware) repo. Kudos to the original [@author](https://github.com/unbug) for such an elegant mini-framework.

## Getting Started

Run `yarn add @dimesoftware/ts-middleware`  or `npm install @dimesoftware/ts-middleware` to add the package to your project.

The usage is more or less the same as [js-middleware](https://github.com/unbug/js-middleware) repo.

## About this project

## Build

You need the latest version of **yarn** and **TypeScript** to run this project.
After that's done, run `yarn install` or simply `yarn to install the requirements.
